# Workshop Three Online Store 

## Understanding the problem

    - User input

- Outputs
    - Command-Line Interface (CLI)

## Making a plan
``
// Pseudocode
//Inputs
// Using Scanner to take an initial user menu command
// First asking to show which products are available, show the checked out products, add additional products and to exit the application.
// After the prompt the use will input a number
// There will be a menu for each option except the exit option to allow the user to check out a product.
// Print to the CLI the result of the user options
``

## Developers Favorite piece of code

![Favorite piece of code wkshop3.png](Favorite%20piece%20of%20code%20wkshop3.png) 

This was our favorite piece because we wanted to make the graphical user interface more aesthetically pleasing for the user.
This piece of code allows each product to be printed out with their sku first then department name, name of the product, and price. 
Which allowed for an easier view for the user.
